## Dataset Setup

Download CASIA 2 dataset from:
[CASIA 2 Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divg07/casia-20-image-tampering-detection-dataset/data)

### CASIA v2 Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following folders:

- `Au/` â†’ Authentic (real) images
- `Tp/` â†’ Tampered (forged) images
- `CASIA2 Groundtruth/` â†’ Binary masks for tampered images

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Training the Model

To train the DPMSN model, run:

```sh
python train.py
```

#### Expected Console Output (Training):
```
Epoch [1/10], Loss: 0.3543
Epoch [2/10], Loss: 0.3011
...
Training Completed!
```
After training completes, check the `models/` folder for the file `image_forgery_detection_casia2.h5`.

## Running the Web Application

To launch the Flask web app, run:

```sh
python app.py
```

Then, open your browser and visit:

```
